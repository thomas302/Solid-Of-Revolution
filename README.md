# Solid-Of-Revolution
OpenSCAD script that can be used to generate solids of revolution.

## Requirements

In order to use the script you need to download and install [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). Once OpenSCAD is installed, download the script and open it.

Upon running the script, a solid of revolution is generated based on the functions entered as f(x) and g(x).  
In order to do a standard revolution around the x-axis set g(x) equal to 0.  If you want to do a solid of revolution around the y-axis comment out lines 24 and 28 by adding // to the beginning of the lines.
